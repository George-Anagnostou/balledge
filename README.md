# Sports Player Chain Game üèàüèÄ‚öæ

A fun web game where players connect sports athletes by matching letters! The first letter of the next player's first name must match the first letter of the previous player's last name.

## How to Play

1. Enter any sports player name to start
2. For subsequent players, the first letter of their first name must match the first letter of the previous player's last name
3. Build the longest chain possible!

## Known Bugs

- Name suffixes are incorrectly captured as last names (e.g. John Smith Jr. -> last name initial = "J").
- Names can sometimes match imprecicely. For example, Will Smith will match Willie Smith (likely matches "W" of first name and "Smith" for last name)

## Example Chain
- **Trey Alexander** ‚Üí **Anthony Black**
